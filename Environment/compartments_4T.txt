# compartments_default.txt contains the compartments considered by the model.        
# It is possible to insert new compartments or comment out existing ones.    
# Lines starting with '''''''''''''''''''''''#''''''''''''''' are comments. Lines are either comments or data.    
# Beware of empty lines (particularly at the end of the file) !    
#                
# The first non-comment line contains the names of the variables.      
# These names are used in the code  only change them if you know what you
# are doing !

# Columns:               
#                
# ID : integer number of the compartment         
# name : a description  must be valid Python dictionary key (no spaces etc.)  
# temp_variable : the variable name that contains the temperature       
# of the compartment (in seasonal_default.txt)           
# halflife_variable : variable name that contains the halflife of chemicals      
# in the compartment : (in chemicals_default.txt)          
# EA_variable : variable name that contains activation energy of chemicals      
# in the compartment : (in chemicals_default.txt)
