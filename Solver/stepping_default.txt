# stepping.txt connects period and step (usually year and month)
# to an actual time-offset (from t0).
#
# The format is as whitespace-seperated list of:
# duration(hours)_of step_1 duration_of_step2 ...... duration_of_last_step
#
# The typical (dynamic) BETR-Global entry would be
# 730 730 730 730 730 730 730 730 730 730 730 730

# For steady-state evaluations of the model, this file is not used.
